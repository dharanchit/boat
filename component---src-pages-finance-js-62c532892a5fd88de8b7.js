For example, lets take the case of Relience Industries Ltd(RELIANCE) as of 26th Sept 2021 it is trading at ₹2,483. Its earning per share is ₹75.98. So P/E ratio will be 32.67. For this ratio can be high for certain companies like ICICIPRULI for which P/E is 200 as on 26th Sept. This ratio can only be high if either the nominator is high or denominator is low i.e, price is high compared to earnings per share or vice versa. Imo the earning per share for the company should be high then it is safer to stay invested in that for a longer period."},{"title":"ROCE","description":"Return on Capital Employed(ROCE) is the profitabilty of the company on its investments. ROCE takes company debt in picture as well. It is calculated as earnings before tax and interest(Operational Income) by total assests - current liabilites.
